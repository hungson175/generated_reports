# Evaluating the Investment Potential of Vietnamese Stocks in 2024

The Vietnamese stock market has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past 24 years, evolving from a nascent market with just five listed securities to a robust and dynamic financial hub. As of 2024, the market's capitalization has reached significant milestones, reflecting its growing importance in the global financial landscape. This report aims to evaluate whether investing in Vietnamese stocks in 2024 is a prudent decision, considering the current economic conditions, market trends, and future projections.

Vietnam's economic outlook for 2024 is generally positive, with various indicators suggesting a stable and growing economy. According to a [World Bank report](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/04/23/viet-nam-s-economy-poised-for-gradual-recovery-world-bank-report-finds), the country's GDP is expected to grow by 5.5% in 2024, gradually rising to 6.0% by 2025. This growth is supported by a recovery in exports and a gradual increase in domestic consumption and private investment. Additionally, the [Vietnamese government](https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/vietnams-economic-outlook-is-positive-in-2024-bloomberg-68964.html) has maintained accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, which are expected to sustain economic momentum.

The stock market itself has shown promising signs. The [Vietnam Ho Chi Minh Stock Index](https://tradingeconomics.com/vietnam/stock-market) has increased by 12.58% since the beginning of 2024, indicating strong investor confidence. Furthermore, the market is expected to trade at around 1,272.19 points by the end of this quarter. Analysts from [KIS Vietnam Securities](https://theinvestor.vn/vietnam-stock-market-to-grow-strongly-in-2024-kis-vietnam-securities-d7833.html) predict a breakthrough in the stock market due to the recovery of the domestic macro economy and supportive government policies.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to play a crucial role in Vietnam's economic landscape. In the first half of 2024, FDI inflows reached nearly $15.2 billion, marking a 13.1% annual increase, as reported by the [General Statistics Office](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnam-economy-h1-2024-key-indicators-and-growth-forecast.html/). This influx of capital is expected to bolster various sectors, including high-tech, electronics, and automotive industries, further enhancing the stock market's attractiveness.

However, the market is not without its challenges. Inflation is forecasted at 3.5% for 2024, which, while manageable, could impact investor sentiment in the short term. Additionally, the market's upgrade from frontier to emerging status is still pending, with potential reviews by [FTSE](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/07/vietnamese-stock-market-sees-remarkable-24-year-transformation-36-575360.htm) and [MSCI](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/07/vietnamese-stock-market-sees-remarkable-24-year-transformation-36-575360.htm) expected in the coming years. An upgrade could lead to significant inflows from funds tracking the MSCI Emerging Markets index, but until then, the market may experience volatility.

In conclusion, the Vietnamese stock market in 2024 presents a compelling investment opportunity, driven by strong economic fundamentals, supportive government policies, and increasing foreign investment. However, potential investors should remain cautious of short-term fluctuations and monitor ongoing developments regarding market upgrades and inflation trends.

## Historical Performance and Evolution of the Vietnamese Stock Market

### Early Development and Milestones

The Vietnamese stock market has undergone significant transformation since its inception. The first trading session was held on July 28, 2000, at the Hồ Chí Minh Securities Trading Centre, now known as the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE). At that time, the market had only five listed securities, 32.1 million shares, and a market capitalization of VNĐ986 billion (US$39 million), which was a mere 0.28% of GDP ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/07/vietnamese-stock-market-sees-remarkable-24-year-transformation-36-575360.htm)).

### Growth in Market Capitalization and Liquidity

Over the past 24 years, the Vietnamese stock market has seen substantial growth in market capitalization and liquidity. By the first quarter of 2022, the market's total capitalization reached 134.5% of GDP, on par with the banking credit market. The market cap continued its upward trend, standing at VNĐ6.9 quadrillion by May 2024, which is 68% of GDP ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/07/vietnamese-stock-market-sees-remarkable-24-year-transformation-36-575360.htm)).

### Legislative and Regulatory Framework

The 2006 Securities Law laid the foundation for the development of Vietnam's securities market by protecting investor interests and aligning with international practices. This law was amended in 2010 and 2019 to address emerging constraints and keep pace with market evolution and the country's deeper economic integration ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/07/vietnamese-stock-market-sees-remarkable-24-year-transformation-36-575360.htm)).

### Market Upgrades and Foreign Investment

A key task for attracting foreign capital has been meeting the criteria to upgrade Vietnam's market from frontier to emerging status. Efforts have been made to resolve bottlenecks and move closer to this goal. BIDV Securities JSC (BSC) believes that FTSE may consider upgrading Vietnam in its September 2024 review, and MSCI could add Vietnam to its watchlist by June 2025 ([Vietstock](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/07/vietnamese-stock-market-sees-remarkable-24-year-transformation-36-575360.htm)).

### Performance Metrics and Investor Sentiment

The VN-Index, Vietnam's benchmark stock index, has shown resilience and growth over the years. As of September 2024, the VN-Index increased by 12.58% since the beginning of the year, reaching 1,271.27 points ([Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/vietnam/stock-market)). The market is expected to trade at 1,272.19 points by the end of this quarter and 1,237.78 in 12 months ([Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/vietnam/stock-market)).

### Sectoral Performance and Trends

Different sectors have shown varied performance over the years. In 2023, the securities group saw an increase of 120%, civil construction increased by 86%, steel by 60%, and seaports by 54.6% ([Vietnam.vn](https://www.vietnam.vn/en/trien-vong-cho-thi-truong-chung-khoan-nam-2024/)). The market liquidity has also changed positively since May 2023 after the State Bank of Vietnam began lowering operating interest rates ([Vietnam.vn](https://www.vietnam.vn/en/trien-vong-cho-thi-truong-chung-khoan-nam-2024/)).

### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Economic Indicators

Vietnam has seen a surge in FDI, which has positively impacted the stock market. In the early months of 2024, FDI increased by 38.6%, totaling over US$4.29 billion compared to the same period in 2023 ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)). The surge in newly registered projects, which rose by 55.5% to 405, underscores strong investor confidence ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)).

### Future Prospects and Market Sentiment

Looking ahead, the Vietnamese stock market is expected to grow strongly in 2024, driven by the recovery of the domestic macro economy and supportive policies from the government and the State Bank of Vietnam ([KIS Vietnam Securities](https://theinvestor.vn/vietnam-stock-market-to-grow-strongly-in-2024-kis-vietnam-securities-d7833.html)). Analysts predict that the VN-Index could reach 1,300 points by the end of 2024 ([Vietnam.vn](https://www.vietnam.vn/en/co-hoi-tang-truong-cho-thi-truong-chung-khoan-nam-2024/)).

### Conclusion

The historical performance and evolution of the Vietnamese stock market indicate a robust and growing market with significant potential for future growth. The market has evolved from a rudimentary state to a sophisticated and integral part of the Vietnamese economy, attracting both domestic and foreign investors. With continued regulatory improvements, sectoral growth, and increasing foreign investment, the Vietnamese stock market presents promising opportunities for investors in 2024 and beyond.


## Economic Outlook and Key Drivers for 2024

### Macroeconomic Indicators

Vietnam's economic outlook for 2024 is largely positive, with several key indicators pointing towards robust growth. The GDP growth rate is projected to be between 6% and 6.5%, driven by strong performance in imports, exports, and manufacturing activities ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)). The World Bank forecasts a GDP growth of 5.5% for 2024, gradually rising to 6.0% by 2025 ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/04/23/viet-nam-s-economy-poised-for-gradual-recovery-world-bank-report-finds)).

Inflation is expected to be manageable, with forecasts predicting a rate of 3.5% to 4% for 2024 ([Vietnam Economy](https://en.vneconomy.vn/vietnam-inflation-outlook-experts-see-higher-prices-in-2024-but-growth-remains-robust.htm)). This is within the government's planned range and should allow for continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) is expected to maintain the policy interest rate steady, leaving the government to focus on stimulating economic growth through investment and expenditure ([Bloomberg](https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/vietnams-economic-outlook-is-positive-in-2024-bloomberg-68964.html)).

### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

FDI continues to be a significant driver of Vietnam's economic growth. In the early months of 2024, Vietnam witnessed a remarkable 38.6% increase in FDI, totaling over $4.29 billion compared to the same period in 2023 ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)). Chinese companies have significantly boosted their investments in Vietnam, focusing on expanding operations or shifting production to the country. This trend is particularly evident in the high-tech, electronics, and automotive sectors ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)).

The Vietnamese government actively encourages further Chinese investment, particularly in areas like innovation, green growth, and digital transformation ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)). This influx of FDI is not limited to traditional sectors; for instance, Foxconn has invested $383 million in a new circuit board plant in Bac Ninh Province ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)).

### Sectoral Performance

#### Manufacturing and Exports

The manufacturing sector is expected to be a significant contributor to economic growth in 2024. The Vietnam Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index saw the sharpest increase in new business since March 2011 ([Cimigo](https://www.cimigo.com/en/research-reports/2024-vietnam-economic-outlook/)). Real exports are expected to grow by 3.5% in 2024, reflecting gradual improvement in global demand ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/04/23/viet-nam-s-economy-poised-for-gradual-recovery-world-bank-report-finds)).

#### Real Estate and Construction

The real estate sector is anticipated to recover in the second half of 2024, bolstering domestic demand as investors and consumers regain confidence ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/04/23/viet-nam-s-economy-poised-for-gradual-recovery-world-bank-report-finds)). The government's focus on infrastructure development and digital economy initiatives will further bolster economic expansion ([Vietnam Investment Snapshot](https://vietnam.acclime.com/news-insights/vietnam-investment-snapshot-2024/)).

#### Consumer and Retail

The consumer and retail sectors are also expected to perform well in 2024. Retail sales of consumer goods and services at current prices were estimated at 6,231.8 trillion VND ($252 billion) in 2023, representing a 9.6% increase compared to 2022 ([Vietnam Investment Snapshot](https://vietnam.acclime.com/news-insights/vietnam-investment-snapshot-2024/)). For the first quarter of 2024, retail sales were estimated at 1.53 quadrillion VND ($61.2 billion), reflecting an 8.2% year-on-year growth ([Vietnam Investment Snapshot](https://vietnam.acclime.com/news-insights/vietnam-investment-snapshot-2024/)).

### Monetary and Fiscal Policies

The SBV's monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, with the refinancing interest rate likely to stay at 4.5% through 2025 ([Bloomberg](https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/vietnams-economic-outlook-is-positive-in-2024-bloomberg-68964.html)). This dovish stance will reduce pressure on the VND exchange rate, creating conditions for Vietnam to continue implementing loose monetary policy to support growth ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)).

The government is also expected to continue its fiscal expansion policy, promoting public investment and infrastructure development. This is anticipated to drive economic growth and improve business results for companies, thereby supporting the stock market ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)).

### Stock Market Prospects

#### Market Performance and Valuation

The Vietnamese stock market is expected to perform strongly in 2024, driven by the recovery of the domestic macro economy and supportive government policies ([KIS Vietnam Securities](https://theinvestor.vn/vietnam-stock-market-to-grow-strongly-in-2024-kis-vietnam-securities-d7833.html)). The VN-Index is projected to have a good chance to surpass the 1,130-point threshold at the beginning of the new year and advance towards the 1,150-point level ([Vietnam Plus](https://en.vietnamplus.vn/vietnam-stock-market-2024-promising-opportunities-for-foreign-investors-post279847.vnp)).

#### Foreign Investment

Foreign investors are expected to return to net buying in the Vietnamese stock market in 2024, driven by the anticipated upgrade of Vietnam's market status from "frontier" to "emerging" ([The Investor](https://theinvestor.vn/foreign-investors-to-be-net-vietnam-stock-buyers-in-2024-experts-d8326.html)). This upgrade could attract additional foreign capital flows of up to $5-8 billion ([The Investor](https://theinvestor.vn/foreign-investors-to-be-net-vietnam-stock-buyers-in-2024-experts-d8326.html)).

#### Sectoral Focus

Key sectors expected to attract investment include banking, real estate, and steel, which have high liquidity and are closely linked to the overall market index ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)). In the first half of 2024, industries related to import and export, such as fisheries, wooden furniture, iron and steel, and logistics/seaports, are expected to attract cash flow due to improved business results ([Vietnam Briefing](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/vietnams-investment-surge-in-2024-key-trends-and-opportunities.html/)).

### Risks and Challenges

Despite the positive outlook, there are several risks and challenges that could impact the Vietnamese stock market in 2024. These include global economic uncertainties, political tensions, and climate change ([Vietnam News](https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1650483/securities-companies-bullish-on-vietnamese-stock-market.html)). Additionally, inflationary pressures and profit margin challenges in specific industries could pose risks to economic stability ([Vietnam Economy](https://en.vneconomy.vn/vietnam-inflation-outlook-experts-see-higher-prices-in-2024-but-growth-remains-robust.htm)).

### Conclusion

In summary, the economic outlook for Vietnam in 2024 is positive, with strong GDP growth, manageable inflation, and significant FDI inflows. The stock market is expected to perform well, driven by supportive government policies and the anticipated upgrade to emerging market status. However, investors should remain cautious of potential risks and challenges that could impact market performance.


## Investment Opportunities and Risks in 2024

### Market Valuation and Growth Potential

The Vietnamese stock market is poised for significant growth in 2024, driven by a combination of favorable economic conditions and strategic policy implementations. Analysts from various securities firms, including [National Securities Inc (NSI)](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/securities-companies-bullish-on-vietnamese-stock-market-2249482.html) and [VNDirect Securities](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/securities-companies-bullish-on-vietnamese-stock-market-2249482.html), project the VN-Index to reach the 1,400-1,450 point range. This optimistic outlook is underpinned by the anticipated recovery of the domestic economy and supportive government policies.

The [P/E ratio](https://vietnamesestockmarket.com/2024/07/22/vietnam-stock-market-performance-overview-june-qtr-2024/) of the VN-Index is currently at 16.5 times, which is considered reasonable and attractive for investors. Forward P/E ratios are even lower, supported by strong expected earnings per share (EPS) growth. For instance, [Dragon Capital](https://vietnamesestockmarket.com/2024/07/22/vietnam-stock-market-performance-overview-june-qtr-2024/) forecasts a 2024 forward P/E of 11.6x and EPS growth of 18.5%.

### Sectoral Opportunities

#### Large-Cap Stocks

2024 is expected to be the year of large-cap stocks with low valuations. According to [Lã Giang Trung, CEO of Passion Investment](https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1650483/securities-companies-bullish-on-vietnamese-stock-market.html), large-cap stocks will drive a strong breakthrough in the VN-Index, although very few stocks will outperform the index. This shift from small and mid-cap stocks, which led the market's growth in 2023, presents a unique opportunity for investors to focus on undervalued large-cap stocks.

#### Real Estate and Construction

The real estate and construction sectors are anticipated to experience a recovery in the second half of 2024. [Dinh Quang Hinh, Head of Macro and Market Strategy at VNDirect Securities](https://www.vietnam.vn/en/trien-vong-cho-thi-truong-chung-khoan-nam-2024/), highlights that the real estate market is expected to rebound as the bond market and real estate sectors escape the bottom and begin a recovery cycle. This recovery is likely to be supported by the government's expansionary fiscal policies and wage reforms.

#### Consumer and Retail

The consumer and retail sectors are also expected to benefit from positive economic policies and increased consumer spending. According to [Cimigo's Vietnam Economic Outlook](https://www.cimigo.com/en/research-reports/2024-vietnam-economic-outlook/), retail sales in the first quarter of 2024 grew by 8.2% year-on-year, reflecting strong consumer demand. This trend is expected to continue, driven by wage reforms and improved employee income.

### Foreign Investment and Market Upgrades

Foreign investors are expected to return to net buying in the Vietnamese stock market in 2024. [Experts](https://theinvestor.vn/foreign-investors-to-be-net-vietnam-stock-buyers-in-2024-experts-d8326.html) predict that the market status upgrade from "frontier" to "emerging" will attract significant foreign capital flows. BIDV Securities (BSC) forecasts that foreign investors will increase net purchases by $700 million, supported by the narrowing interest rate difference between the U.S. dollar and the Vietnamese dong as the U.S. Federal Reserve begins to reduce interest rates.

The potential upgrade of Vietnam's stock market status is a significant catalyst for foreign investment. [FTSE](https://en.vietstock.vn/2024/07/vietnamese-stock-market-sees-remarkable-24-year-transformation-36-575360.htm) may consider upgrading Vietnam in its September 2024 review, and MSCI could add Vietnam to its watchlist by June 2025. This upgrade would open the door to significant inflows from funds tracking the MSCI Emerging Markets index.

### Risks and Challenges

#### Macroeconomic Uncertainties

Despite the optimistic outlook, the Vietnamese stock market faces several risks and challenges. [Vũ Thị Chân Phương, Chairwoman of the State Securities Commission](https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1650483/securities-companies-bullish-on-vietnamese-stock-market.html), notes that the market's future developments will largely depend on macroeconomic policies and the domestic and global economic prospects. The Vietnamese economy is expected to face difficulties amid climate change, increasing political tensions, global economic uncertainties, and complex movements in international financial markets.

#### Inflation and Interest Rates

Inflationary pressures are another significant risk. [Dr. Can Van Luc, Chief Economist of BIDV Bank](https://en.vneconomy.vn/vietnam-inflation-outlook-experts-see-higher-prices-in-2024-but-growth-remains-robust.htm), predicts that Vietnam's inflation rate may reach 3.5-4% in 2024, driven by a strengthening economy, wage increases, and rising costs in key sectors. While interest rates are likely to edge higher, they are expected to remain below 4%, which is still favorable compared to many other regional and global economies.

#### Bureaucratic and Regulatory Hurdles

Bureaucratic delays and regulatory hurdles continue to pose challenges for investors. [Cimigo](https://www.cimigo.com/en/research-reports/2024-vietnam-economic-outlook/) expects continued volatility in 2024, exacerbated by delays in government approvals that are unlikely to be resolved before the next national assembly election in May 2026. This bureaucratic stagnation impedes infrastructure spending, a crucial growth driver.

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Diversification and Sectoral Focus

Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios across various sectors to mitigate risks. Focusing on large-cap stocks with low valuations, as well as sectors poised for recovery such as real estate, construction, consumer, and retail, can provide balanced exposure to growth opportunities.

#### Monitoring Macroeconomic Indicators

Keeping a close watch on macroeconomic indicators, including inflation rates, interest rates, and government policies, is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Investors should be prepared to adjust their strategies in response to changes in these indicators.

#### Leveraging Foreign Investment Trends

With the anticipated market upgrade and increased foreign investment, investors should consider stocks with large capitalization that still have "ownership room" for foreign investors. Sectors such as banking, retail, and steel, which have attracted significant foreign capital, present promising opportunities.

### Conclusion

The Vietnamese stock market in 2024 offers a mix of opportunities and risks. While the market is expected to grow strongly, driven by favorable economic conditions and strategic policy implementations, investors must navigate macroeconomic uncertainties, inflationary pressures, and bureaucratic hurdles. By diversifying portfolios, monitoring macroeconomic indicators, and leveraging foreign investment trends, investors can capitalize on the growth potential of the Vietnamese stock market in 2024.
