### What is God?

**Imagine a Super Parent**

Think of the nicest, kindest, and most loving parent you can imagine. Now, imagine that parent is also super strong and can do anything! That's a bit like what God is. God is like the best parent ever, who loves everyone very much and takes care of the whole world.

### How Did God Make Everything?

**The Great Creator**

Do you like to create things with Legos or draw pictures? God is like a super artist who made everything we see: the sky, the trees, animals, and even you and me! Just like you feel happy when you finish a Lego building, God is happy with all the things He made.

### How Do We Know About God?

**Through Stories**

Have you ever heard a bedtime story? There are special stories called Bible stories that tell us about God. One famous story is about Noah and his big boat, where he saved lots of animals. These stories help us understand what God is like and how He takes care of us.

### Where is God?

**Everywhere and in Your Heart**

Imagine the air around you. You can't see it, but it's there, and you need it to breathe. God is kind of like that. Even though we can't see Him, He's everywhere and always with us. He’s also in our hearts, making us feel loved and safe.

### Why Do We Talk to God?

**Like Talking to a Friend**

Do you like to talk to your friends or family when you're happy or sad? Talking to God is like that. We can pray to Him anytime to tell Him about our day, ask for help, or thank Him for all the good things. It's like having a forever friend who always listens.

### How Does God Show His Love?

**Through Kindness and Caring People**

Ever had someone do something really nice for you, like your mom making your favorite snack or a friend sharing their toys? That’s one way God shows His love—through the kindness and actions of people around us.

### Can We See God?

**Seeing Through His Creations**

Even though we can't see God like we see our friends, we can see the amazing things He made. When you look at a beautiful sunset or a cute puppy, you’re seeing a little bit of God’s work. It's like seeing a beautiful painting and knowing someone special made it.

### Why Do We Go to Church?

**A Place to Learn About and Feel God**

Church is like a big family gathering where people come together to learn about God, sing songs, and pray. It's a place where we can feel close to God and understand more about His love.

### Asking Questions is Good!

**Stay Curious**

It's great to ask questions about God! Just like you ask your parents about why the sky is blue, asking about God helps you learn and understand more. Keep asking, and you'll keep learning wonderful things about how much God loves you.
