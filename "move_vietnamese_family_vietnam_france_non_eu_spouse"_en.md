# How to Move a Vietnamese Family from Vietnam to France with One Non-EU Spouse

Moving a Vietnamese family to France, especially when one spouse is a non-EU citizen, involves navigating a complex set of immigration procedures and requirements. This introduction provides an overview of the essential steps and considerations for Vietnamese citizens planning to relocate to France with a non-EU spouse.

France offers various visa options tailored to different purposes of stay, such as work, study, or family reunification. For Vietnamese citizens, the process begins with determining the appropriate visa type based on the primary reason for moving. The [French visa for Vietnamese citizens](https://france-immigration.lawyer/french-visa-for-vietnamese/) can be awarded for multiple purposes, including work, study, or family reunification.

### Visa Requirements and Application Process

The initial step involves applying for a long-stay visa (Visa de Long Séjour) at the French embassy or consulate in Vietnam. This visa is essential for stays exceeding 90 days and is a prerequisite for obtaining a residence permit in France. The [required documents](https://visaguide.world/europe/france-visa/requirements/) for the visa application include proof of identity, marriage certificate, proof of financial means, and other relevant documents depending on the applicant's employment status.

### Family Reunification

For family reunification, the non-EU spouse and dependent family members must apply for a [Carte de Séjour](https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/france/moving/residency/eu-member-state-citizens) (residence permit) within three months of entering France. This permit allows them to live and work in France and is valid for up to five years. The application process requires submitting various documents, including proof of relationship, proof of residency in France, and an attestation of non-polygamy.

### Special Considerations for Non-EU Spouses

Non-EU spouses of EU citizens residing in France have specific rights and obligations. They can enter France without a visa for short stays but must apply for a [Carte de Séjour “membre de la famille d’un citoyen de l’Union”](https://www.frenchentree.com/living-in-france/moving-to-france/french-residency-can-i-join-my-eu-spouse-or-family-member-in-france/) within three months of arrival. This residency card is crucial for legal stay and work authorization in France.

### Conclusion

Relocating a Vietnamese family to France with a non-EU spouse requires careful planning and adherence to French immigration laws. By understanding the visa requirements, application procedures, and specific considerations for non-EU family members, Vietnamese citizens can successfully navigate the process and establish their new life in France. For detailed guidance and assistance, consulting with immigration experts or legal advisors is highly recommended.
